I want to create a super simple data entry and analysis tool to track qual. and quant. data about my students. 

I want it to be super simple and easy to deploy (perhaps using streamlit, so I can work from a URL in my browser).

It should have several features:

- an add class function where I add my students names
- a HW tracking function where I can see a calendar of the month/week and select HW submission status for each student, every day (either on-time or late - red or green, or grey for absent/valid excuse)
- a comment system where I can input a comment about a students performance and some evidence from the moment I notice it. These should be categorised as either English, UOI, or General Behaviour. All these comments must be stored against each students' name so I can use the data to generate a report for each student at the end of the term.
- a dictation score tracking tool where I can create a dictation task, upload the MP3 and the transcript, then input each students written attempt and generate a score which is saved against that student, as well as some feedback for the student (in both English and Chinese)
- a weekly spelling test score input system (out of 20 points) which calcuates their percentage score each week (one text per week) and also calculates the class average each week and then an average for each student at the end of each term (to see how they are performing at spelling)
- a grammar error data entry feature, where I can add a grammar error which is categorised against the top errors for chinese learners learning English (subject-verb agreement, verb tense, articles, prepositions, word order etc) and it stored against that student. This should then produce an analysis so I can see which errors are being made the most and where each students' weakspots are. 
- essay marking tool aligned to ISA Year 4 standards
- a to-do list for myself to add to and mark tasks as done/in progress. 

I will need some kind of simple way to store the data too... I need this to be lightweight but functional and the data must be safe for accidental deletion. 

I will use this tool to track student performance.

Please help me set this up. Do it carefully and gradually.
